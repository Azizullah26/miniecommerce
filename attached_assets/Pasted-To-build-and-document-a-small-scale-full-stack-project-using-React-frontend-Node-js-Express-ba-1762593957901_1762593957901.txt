To build and document a small-scale full stack project using React (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), SQLite (for local DB), and a mock AWS deployment plan. The output should include working source code, folder structure, and clear documentation in README.md.

🧩 Technical Requirements
1. Frontend (React + Vite)

Create a clean, responsive interface with:

A product list showing: Product Name, Price, Category, and Stock Status.

A form to add new products with validation.

Use Axios or Fetch to connect with the backend.

Use simple CSS or Tailwind for styling.

Bonus: Include pagination and category filtering.

2. Backend (Node.js + Express)

REST API with endpoints:

GET /products → Fetch all products

POST /products → Add new product

Store data in SQLite (for local use) or MySQL (configurable).

Validate incoming requests.

Use modular folder structure:

backend/
  src/
    index.js
    routes/products.js
    controllers/productController.js
    db.js


Include .env.example with DB config and port variables.

3. Database

Schema:

products (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT,
  price REAL,
  category TEXT,
  stock_status TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

4. AWS / Cloud Integration (Documentation Only)

In README.md, include how to deploy:

API on AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk

Database on AWS RDS

Product images on AWS S3

Include IAM role setup, cost-free mock config, and CI/CD (GitHub Actions).

5. Documentation Requirements

Generate a README.md that includes:

Project Overview

Tech Stack Justification

Architecture Overview (simple diagram or description)

Task Breakdown for a 3-member team (frontend, backend, devops)

Deployment Plan (AWS steps)

Future Enhancements section

Local setup guide (commands to run backend/frontend)

Example API request/responses

Also include inline comments in code explaining each step.

🧠 Bonus Features (Optional)

Basic JWT authentication for admin login to access POST /products.

Add pagination or category filter in product list.

Add Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml for local setup.

📦 Deliverables

The final output should contain:

frontend/ folder (React app)

backend/ folder (Express + SQLite)

README.md file with full documentation

.env.example

docker-compose.yml (optional)

Example screenshots or Loom recording note

⚙️ Output Format

Please generate:

Full project folder structure with files and code (in Replit workspace).

A detailed README.md (well-formatted markdown) at the root describing everything above.

Commented code and easy-to-run scripts.

🧭 Example run commands (to include in README)
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
node src/index.js

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
